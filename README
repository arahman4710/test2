Basic scraping tools for fetchopia.   

With the exception of the hotwire api tools, these are pretty much as I got them, 
we should now push updates into this structure (or perhaps create new subfolders
as required).  

Down in subdirectories there are csv files from earlier scrapings.  

The hotwire scraper "hotwire_api_analysis" is the old one, the version I just hacked up
is in "hotwire_api".
