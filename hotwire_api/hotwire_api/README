Top level for hotwire_api scraper.    

See hotwire information on the api at http://developer.hotwire.com/docs/read/Home

This is not currently set up to be run from scrapyd, but either by hand or repeatedly via something like cron.

Output files are now json rather than csv.   Ideally this should be run with configuration read from a database or other input mechanisms instead of internal settings, and output should go to a database, but which database and how?
